Contains EDA/Jupyter files as well as datasets  

Hi,
This is an  overview of the submission folder. The folder contains two jupyter notebooks.
EDA has been performed majorly using Tableau software. I have also attached the dashboards so that data exploration is visible .
Screenshots of confusion matrices observed both numeric as well as after encoding have been attached.
